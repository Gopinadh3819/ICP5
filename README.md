    -visualized data before and after reconstruction using matplotlib

    
Q2)- Added multiple hidden layers and dropout layers for better model accuracy
   - modified optimizer for better results
   - plotted loss and accuracy using history object
   - plotted original noisy images and reconstructed images where noise is removed using matplotlib
